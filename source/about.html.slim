      p Founded in 2014, Rails Girls Malaysia is a part of the worldwide non-profit organization #{link_to 'Rails Girls', 'http://railsgirls.com/', target: '_blank'} that started in Finland.
      
      p Rails Girls Malaysia the aims to give tools and a community for women to understand technology and to build their ideas. We do this by organizing workshops that provide a great experience on building things and by making technology more approachable.

      p These workshops are led by skilled Ruby on Rails programmers who are eager to help newbies and to increase the number of women in IT. During our workshops, we try to create a cozy space where questions are welcome and where there is no pressure nor competition. To accomplish that, we keep the group sizes small and have one dedicated coach per two or three learners.

      p Learn sketching, prototyping, basic programming and get introduced to the world of technology.
